# GLua Standart

Within the expansive **Garry's Mod community**, a standardized approach to writing Glua code has yet to be defined. Consequently, code contributions from various authors often lack consistency and aesthetic appeal. In response to this challenge, I have taken the initiative to establish the inaugural standard.

I eagerly await your feedback and suggestions for further enhancements :+1:
